**Note:** If the version check command does not work, add Homebrew to the path (`PATH`) to ensure the commands work correctly. To do this, run the following in Terminal:

```bash
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Step 3: Verify Homebrew Installation

Now, to ensure Homebrew is installed correctly, run the command:

```bash
brew doctor
```

### Example of Git installation:

### Example of Python installation:

```

### Step 5: Updating Homebrew

Homebrew makes it easy to update tools and packages.

* To update Homebrew:
