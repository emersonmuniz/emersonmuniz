## Preparing My System for Development/Study

### Introduction

Since I updated my macOS (actually, I installed it from scratch using a patcher for Mavericks on my old MacBook Pro 2011), I am preparing my system to return to my studies in development.

### macOS Installations

* [Installing HomeBrew](https://github.com/emersonmuniz/emersonmuniz/tree/main/articles/macos-mavericks-homebrew)
* [Installing PHP and Laravel](https://github.com/emersonmuniz/emersonmuniz/tree/main/articles/macos-mavericks-php)
* [Using Databases](https://github.com/emersonmuniz/emersonmuniz/tree/main/articles/macos-mavericks-database)

### Linux Installations

*In progress...*

### Conclusion

I hope this material can somehow help beginners in the macOS environment or even in Linux.
